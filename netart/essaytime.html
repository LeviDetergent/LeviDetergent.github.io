<h1>Ranting time</h1>
<p style="color: red; background-color:white;"> Monkeys are one of the most fascinating creatures on the planet. With their intelligence, social behavior,
and curious nature, they have captured the hearts of many as you can see it from the gifs.
Unfortunately, monkey populatoins are in danger due to various human activities such as habitat destruction,
hunting, and pet trade. Thus, this has resulted in a rapid decline in their numbers, with some
species facing the risk of extinction. 
<br>
<br>
The extinction of monkey can cause some serious issue to the ecosystem. Monkeys play
a major role in nature, from seed dispersal, plant pollination to insect population control,
and with a single missing link in this ecological chain, it could have a domino effect
on other species, which could disrupt the balance of the ecosystem. 
<br>
<br>
The main cause of monkey population decline is due to habitat destruction. As human population
increasing, we continue to clear forests for agriculture and buildings, leaving monkeys with nowhere to
live. Hunting and pet trade are also contribute to the decline, as they are captured for food or sold as pets.
<br>
<br>
It is significant that we must take action to prevent the extinction of these intelligent creatures.
We must protect their habitat, enforce laws that prevent hunting and pet trade to maintain their population.</p>
