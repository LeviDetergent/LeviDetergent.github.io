<br>

<p> As a Vietnamese digital artist living in the United States with a background in computer science, I have found that creating art provides me with a space to express myself and explore the intersection of my two cultures. 
Pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University, my ultimate goal is to become a game designer and utilize my skills and experience to create immersive and culturally representative gaming experiences. 
I am passionate about bridging the gap between Vietnamese and American cultures and hope to bring more visibility and representation to my community through my art. 
By exploring themes of identity, culture, and representation, I aspire to create meaningful and impactful art that connects with and resonates with a broader audience.</p>
