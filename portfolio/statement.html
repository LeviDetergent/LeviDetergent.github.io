<br>

<p> As a digital artist, I like to make appealing work that also represents contemporary society. I have a background in computer science, which gives me the ability to push the boundaries of traditional art and explore the connection between creativity and technology.
<br>
<br>
I am pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University, where I'm always looking for fresh ways to infuse my work with joy and humor. I draw inspiration from online culture and its impact on our culture in everything I do, from making meme mashups to creating net art.
<br>
<br>
My ultimate goal is to become a game designer so that I can use both my creative and technical knowledge to create enjoyable and culturally significant gaming experiences. As a Vietnamese-American digital artist, I strive to represent and support my community via my creations and to show off the rich diversity and beauty of our common culture. I am committed to producing meaningful and memorable works that connect with a wide audience, whether I'm working in digital art, animation, or game design.
