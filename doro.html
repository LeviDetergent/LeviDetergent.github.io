		<p style="margin-top: 30px;">For Exercise 2, Snap to Grid, I created a playful version of the classic snake game, but instead of a snake, I used Doro, a character from the game Nikke. As Doro moves across the grid, the goal is to eat Doritos, with the character's image increasing in size with each bite. I added a vibrant RGB grid background and used a custom font to give the game a unique and nostalgic aesthetic, which reminded me of old-school arcade games.
		<br><br>
		What I enjoyed most about this project was the creative freedom to incorporate a character I like into the game mechanics. Transforming the traditional snake game into something more personal made the coding experience engaging and fun. I particularly enjoyed experimenting with the RGB grid, which gave the game a retro vibe that added to its overall charm.
		<br><br>
		However, the process wasn't without its challenges. Managing the grid structure while ensuring smooth movement for Doro proved to be tricky. The snake needed to stay aligned with the grid, and making sure the movement synced well with the grid's logic took a lot of trial and error. Debugging the collision detection was also tedious, especially when the snake wouldn't respond correctly to food or boundary collisions, making that aspect of the project frustrating at times.
		<br><br>
		The biggest obstacle I encountered was balancing the growth of Doro and the game's speed. Initially, as Doro ate more food and grew in size, the speed increased so much that the game became too difficult to control. To overcome this, I adjusted the scaling so that while Doro continued to grow, the speed gradually decreased, making the game challenging yet still playable. This balancing act made the game more enjoyable and added a layer of strategy without sacrificing the fun of seeing Doro get bigger.</p>
